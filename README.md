## 👋 About Me

I'm a researcher in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), currently based in Los Angeles. My vision is to build AI systems that transcend traditional human cognition paradigms and develop their own unique ways of reasoning and understanding.

## 🔬 Research Interests

- **Non-sequential Decoding and Reasoning**: Exploring novel approaches to AI cognition beyond traditional sequential processing
- **Engineering Task Agents**: Developing specialized AI agents for complex engineering challenges
- **Automated Research**: Pushing the boundaries of AI-driven scientific discovery

## 🎯 Recent Achievements

- 🔬 2025/04: Research Intern at [to be announced]
- 🎉 2025/01: Two papers accepted at ICLR 2025:
  - [Commit0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01769)
  - [GameArena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06394)

## 💻 Technical Stack

My personal website and projects are built with modern web technologies:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Framework**: Remix (App Router)
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI, Radix UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Supabase
- **Development**: Modern development practices with strong typing and performance optimization

## 📚 Recommended Reading
